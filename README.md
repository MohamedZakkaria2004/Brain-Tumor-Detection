# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-MRI-Images-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision

This project focuses on automated brain tumor detection and classification using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques applied to MRI images. A VGG16-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify MRI scans into four categories:

* Glioma

* Meningioma

* Pituitary tumor

* No Tumor

The system is capable of:

* Learning discriminative features from MRI images
* Accurately classifying tumor types
* Providing prediction confidence scores
* Assisting medical professionals as a decision-support tool, not a replacement
